# Telegram Bot for checking students' skills of using gpg

Discklaimer: this bot was targeted for russian students/ If you wnat to use it in another languages, use translation (Maybe i add translation in future? We will see)

This bot get some functions
1. You can add gpg key and try to decrypt message that bit gives you

5. Get (check `secret_info/__init__.py`)
	1. TOKEN 
	2. Adress to your bot
	3. Admin users
	(Way to get it is up to you: you can use env, maybe you hardcode it in file like me)
6. Write your own or use my secret word generator
After that you ready to go, launch bot and enjoy it :)


### Little user guide about admin (because it don't have much description in tg):

Then you enter admin panel, your notifications are off by default.
You can turn it on or turn off again.
Then you turned it on, you can get a new students who are pass the test, ==important==: if some of admins get student name, it will disappear from list and others admins won't see it if they turn their notification on

Good luck, `comrade` :)
